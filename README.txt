# PremiumProjects
Premium Projects from Illusive Enterprises.
Here we will develop Premium & Commerical Add-Ons For all versions of the PHP-Fusion CMS & allow Beta Tetsting our Project Donators. If you make a Donation to our Projects, you can Beta Test any Add-On once it hits Beta Testing Stage!
After the Add-Ons are developed,  they will enter Testing Stage.
Once we test them ourselvees first on our own testing website & they have no issues we can find, they move to Beta.
In Beta Stage, we will release copies of the Beta Add-Ons to our Donators to install, try out and report back to us.
Once our Beta Testers identify issues and bugs, we will fix them then retest the Add-On & it will enter Alpha Stage.
Again our Donators can test all Add-Ons in Alpha Stage and report any issues back to us. Hopefully none are reported at this point.
Once all known issues and bugs are worked out, the Add-On enters Official Release Stage. We will post the Add-Ons on our Premium PHP-Fusion Add-Ons website for sale at this point. 
Each and every person that works on the Add-On will receive a percentage of each and every sale of each Add-On they helped code & design.
